# Arcade-Simulator
This is an arcade simulator that I made during my last semester at community college. I learned how to use SDL2 and with my limited knowledge of C++ created this game over the course of two months. This game consists of three total games: Guess The Number, Space Shooter, Ghost Shooter. All created with a mixture of self made and public domain pixel art.
